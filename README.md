# Uber Rides Data Analysis – Data Science Mini Project
# Description:
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to uncover temporal and geographical patterns in user behavior. It uses Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process, visualize, and interpret the data.

# Objectives:
:-Load and clean raw Uber trip data

:-Extract useful features like hour, day, weekday

:-Analyze ride frequency by hour, day, and base station

:-Visualize ride patterns using line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

:-Identify peak hours and busiest days for Uber rides

:-Generate insights for demand forecasting and operational planning

# Tools & Technologies:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# Key Insights:
--Maximum rides occur during weekday rush hours (8–10 AM, 5–7 PM)

--Friday evenings see a spike in demand

--Base B02617 recorded the highest number of trips

--Patterns suggest that Uber can optimize driver allocation based on day & hour trends

# Conclusion
The Uber ride data was successfully explored and analyzed using Python and various visualization techniques. Through detailed examination of pickup times, locations, and base stations, the project revealed key temporal and spatial patterns.

--Rush hours (8–10 AM and 5–7 PM) experience the highest ride demand.
--Fridays show the peak number of pickups, especially in the evening.
--Among Uber bases, B02617 consistently handles the largest volume of rides.
--Clear patterns in hourly and daily activity suggest that Uber can optimize driver availability and dynamic pricing using time-based demand trends.
